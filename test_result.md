# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The layout adapts well to different viewport sizes (320px to 768px) without horizontal scrolling. The bottom navigation is properly fixed at the bottom of the screen and easily accessible. Quick action buttons and cards have appropriate touch target sizes, though the theme toggle button in the header is slightly smaller than the recommended 44x44px (currently 40x40px). Text is readable on mobile screens with good contrast. The interface is clean, uncluttered, and provides easy access to all functionality on mobile devices. Overall, the mobile experience is excellent for the target users."

User management, product marketplace, price monitoring, animal health, and financial tools APIs are working as expected. Role-based access control is properly implemented (aviculteur/acheteur).

The onNavigate prop is being passed correctly to components. Login form displays correctly, but login functionality fails with 404 error. API endpoint /api/users/login returns 404 Not Found. Backend API might not be running or endpoint path is incorrect. All other navigation features work as expected."

    - message: "API endpoint fixes partially working. The /api/diseases and /api/veterinaires endpoints are now returning 200 responses, but there's a rendering error in the Animal Health component. The login endpoint (/api/users/login) still returns 404, suggesting this endpoint wasn't updated. The symptom reporting functionality couldn't be fully tested due to rendering issues in the Animal Health page."
    - agent: "testing"
    - message: "Detailed API endpoint testing results: 1) Login endpoint (/api/users/login) still returns 404 - this endpoint wasn't updated. 2) Disease and veterinarian endpoints are working (200 responses), but there's a data format mismatch: ModernAnimalHealth.js expects disease.traitement to be an array (using .map()), but App.js treats it as a string. 3) Symptom reporting endpoint (/api/symptoms/report) is accessible but returns an error about missing required query parameter 'user_id'. The frontend is sending user_phone instead."

    - message: "Fixed the double API prefix issue in the backend server.py file. The backend was configured with 'app.include_router(api_router, prefix=\"/api\")' which was causing all API endpoints to have a double /api prefix. Changed to 'app.include_router(api_router)' and restarted the backend server. API endpoints are now accessible and returning data correctly. However, there are still issues with the frontend components not properly rendering the data or handling the API responses correctly."

    - message: "Final testing completed after fixing the double API prefix issue. All functionality is now working correctly. Login, Animal Health data loading, and navigation between all sections are functioning properly.

Role-specific display is correctly implemented in App.js with currentUser.role === aviculteur condition. The component has proper styling with cards grouped in containers and a consistent color scheme.
