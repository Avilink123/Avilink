    - message: "Completed comprehensive testing of all specialized pages for the three roles in AviMarché Mali. For ÉLEVEURS (AVICULTEURS), the FeedMarketPage (Marché des aliments), VeterinaireContactsPage (Contacts vétérinaires), and FeedPricesPage (Prix aliments) are all working correctly. For ACHETEURS, the FavoriteSellersPage (Éleveurs favoris), ReceivedOrdersPage (Stock reçu), and TopSellersPage (Classement éleveurs) are all working correctly. For FOURNISSEURS D'ALIMENTS, the MyFeedProductsPage (Stock aliments), FeedOrdersPage (Commandes aliments), FarmerContactsPage (Clients éleveurs), and PerformanceDashboardPage (Performance) are all working correctly. The registration process for all three roles works correctly, and each role has access to their specialized pages. The navigation between pages works smoothly, and the UI is consistent across all pages. The application is now a complete ecosystem with three separate business roles, each with their own specialized pages and functionality."
