However, when registering as a FOURNISSEUR, the user is not properly redirected to the FournisseurHomePage and doesn't appear to be logged in after registration. This suggests there might be an issue with the authentication or redirection logic specific to the FOURNISSEUR role."

The same is true for AVICULTEUR (redirected to AviculteurHomePage) and ACHETEUR (redirected to AcheteurHomePage). The API call to /api/users/register is now being made correctly, and the user is properly authenticated after registration."

    - message: "I've tested the registration functionality with the new FOURNISSEUR role. The ModernLoginModal and RegistrationPage components have been successfully updated to include the FOURNISSEUR role option. However, there's an issue with the complete registration flow - when registering as a FOURNISSEUR, the user is not properly redirected to the FournisseurHomePage and doesn't appear to be logged in after registration. This suggests there might be an issue with the authentication or redirection logic specific to the FOURNISSEUR role. The UI changes for adding the FOURNISSEUR role option are working correctly, but the end-to-end registration flow needs to be fixed."

    - message: "I'm now testing the newly implemented pages and improvements for AviMarché Mali. I'll be focusing on: 1) VendreVolaillesPage corrections ('Prix total' → 'Prix unitaire', 'Coqs' → 'Pintades', 'Œufs de village' → 'Œufs fécondés'), 2) New pages: BuyFeedPage, BuyChicksPage, MessagesPage, and MyPoultryStockPage, and 3) Navigation from AviculteurHomePage to these new pages. All these pages are designed to be accessible for illiterate users with simple interfaces, big buttons, and visual cues."

    - message: "I attempted to test the new pages for AviMarché Mali, but was unable to log in as an ÉLEVEUR (AVICULTEUR) because the website doesn't store data between sessions. Without being logged in as an ÉLEVEUR, I couldn't access the specialized pages that need to be tested. I've reviewed the code for these pages and they appear to be implemented correctly, but I couldn't verify their functionality through the UI. The code review shows that the navigation structure from AviculteurHomePage to the new pages is correctly implemented, and the new pages (BuyFeedPage, BuyChicksPage, MessagesPage, MyPoultryStockPage) have been created with the required features. The VendreVolaillesPage corrections also appear to be implemented correctly in the code."
